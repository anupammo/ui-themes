  <h1>About HopeFund</h1>

  <!-- Intro -->
  <p><strong>HopeFund</strong> was founded on one belief: every life holds value, and every community deserves opportunity. Since day one, we’ve worked hand-in-hand with partners and changemakers to deliver practical, lasting solutions in the areas of <strong>healthcare access</strong> and <strong>education equity</strong>.</p>

  <!-- H2: Our Mission -->
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>To empower individuals and uplift underserved communities by removing barriers to quality healthcare and education — with compassion, transparency, and dignity at our core.</p>

  <!-- H2: Our Story -->
  <h2>Our Journey</h2>
  <p>What began as a grassroots initiative in 2017 has grown into a multi-cause movement spanning regions, cities, and rural villages. We've distributed medical kits in flood-hit areas, launched school support programs in urban slums, and built alliances across public, private, and nonprofit sectors.</p>

  <!-- H2: What We Value -->
