  <h1>Education for All</h1>

  <p>Education is the key to breaking cycles of poverty and unlocking opportunity. Yet for millions of children, access remains out of reach. At <strong>HopeFund</strong>, we're changing that — one child, one classroom, one future at a time.</p>

  <h2>Programs We Run</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🎒 Learning kits: School bags, books, uniforms, and stationery</li>
    <li>🏫 Back-to-School enrollment campaigns in high-dropout areas</li>
    <li>🧑‍🏫 Community classroom hubs and digital literacy training</li>
    <li>👩‍🎓 Mentorship & tutoring with trained volunteers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact in Action</h2>
  <p><strong>12,000+ students</strong> have joined or returned to school through our programs. Hundreds now receive regular tutoring, and dropout rates have dropped by 48% in supported zones.</p>

  <h2>Be a Catalyst for Learning</h2>
