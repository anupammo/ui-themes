  <h1>Our Causes</h1>

  <p>At <strong>HopeFund</strong>, we focus our energy where it matters most. Our two flagship causes — <a href="causes/healthcare-support.html">Healthcare Support</a> and <a href="causes/education-for-all.html">Education for All</a> — reflect our commitment to basic human dignity, opportunity, and justice.</p>

  <h2><a href="causes/healthcare-support.html">Healthcare Support</a></h2>
  <p>Bringing essential medical care to communities through mobile clinics, health awareness programs, and emergency interventions.</p>

  <h2><a href="causes/education-for-all.html">Education for All</a></h2>
  <p>Unlocking potential by breaking down barriers to learning — from funding school supplies to supporting rural classrooms and literacy drives.</p>

  <p>Each project is designed in collaboration with local leaders and partners. Because when we work together, hope is just the beginning.</p>
