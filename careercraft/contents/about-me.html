  <!-- H2: Personal Ethos -->
  <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I believe in learning by doing and growing by sharing. Whether it's solving problems with code or shaping ideas into visual stories, I thrive at the intersection of curiosity and craftsmanship. My work is grounded in purpose and powered by continual reinvention.</p>

  <!-- H2: My Journey -->

  <p>I’ve worked across [insert industries or types of companies], gaining hands-on experience in [mention core disciplines like web development, UX design, project management, etc.].

  <!-- H2: Where I'm Going -->
  <h2>Where I'm Headed</h2>
  <p>I’m excited about building tools that make life easier, experiences that leave a mark, and systems that scale. Whether that means joining a team of dreamers or helping clients bring their ideas to life — I’m here for it.</p>
